Still in a very very early development....

## merging ion-auth-social
copy and modify Ion Auth 2 - Social
- correcting sql file, some git merge notations left there causing script can't be executed
- removed migration, might come back later because I have different database design in mind
- correcting view/login, some git merge notations left there

Don't clone, don't copy, don't fork.

Do pray.
